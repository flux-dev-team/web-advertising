W3C's [TPAC meeting](https://www.w3.org/2020/10/TPAC/) will be a series of virtual meetings. Let's plan for a BG virtual meeting then. 

Suggested timing: 4 hours/day over 2 days, with breaks. PrivacyCG used this scheduling to account for timezones: 

| Start  | End | Location |
| ------ | --- | -------- |
| 00:00 (Midnight next day) | 04:00 | Tokyo  (UTC+9)|
| 01:00 (next day) | 05:00 | Sydney (UTC+10) |
| 05:00 | 09:00 | UTC-10 |
| 08:00 | 12:00 | San Francisco (UTC-7) |
| 11:00 | 15:00 (3 PM) | Boston (UTC-4)|
| 16:00 (4 PM) | 20:00 (8 PM) | London  (UTC+1)|
| 17:00 (5 PM) | 21:00 (9 PM) | Brussels (UTC+2) |

We would meet over webex or zoom, with IRC, and include breaks.
